Where we're from, there's no sun, our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one, our hometown's in the dark
Our hometown's in the dark

My shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I will let the wind go quietly
I will let the wind go quietly

Put away, put away all the gods your father served today
Put away, put away your traditions, believe me when I say
We don't know, we don't know how to put back the power in our soul
We don't know, we don't know where to find what once was in our bones

Where we're from, there's no sun, our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one, our hometown's in the dark
Our hometown's in the dark

My shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I will let the wind go quietly
I will let the wind go quietly
